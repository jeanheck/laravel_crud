## About this project

This project is just a test to understand more about Laravel. Is just a crud, with a lot of things did wrongly. I just did it to learn how do somethings in Laravel, to help a friend.

If you want to use it local, the prerequisites are:

Xamp, or Wamp, or something like that;
Composer;
Laravel;

Type "php artisan serve" at terminal and go to localhost:8000 to see the project.
